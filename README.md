# Huâ€™s note

my learning note archive

## If you want to build your own note site

All notes are in markdown format, and kept under `docs`.

I use [typora](https://typora.io/) for local editing, and periodically sync it to github. The website is automatically deployed with [mkdocs](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs) after each sync (with [this simple script](https://github.com/zhuhu00/note/sync.sh) on Windows), you can find the related note [here](https://note.zhuhu00.top/mkdocs/).
